## Eanos Mini EP

</div>

The Eanos mini EP, created by `@GER/JUSI Lp` with the help of `@Eric_0815`, will host a variety of new textures and weathered looks. It will also include new types of cargo, such as scrap metal blocks and logs.
The new textures will be randomized, meaning that passing by freight trains won't be all that boring anymore.
When spawning the freight car, you can pick between scrap metal loads or logs as your freight.
You will also have the ability, to place down the end of train boards at each end of the car by clicking the designated holder

## FTF 146 sound mod

Speaking of Frankfurt Fulda already, our very liked 146 sound mod, created by `@Foobian` and `@Raph`, will get updated soon...
It will add brand new recording samples for things such as the gearbox, horn (courtesy of `@Markus`) and many more which will enhance the driving experience even more!
This mod will also merge with the FTF EEP once it's ready to release.

## TRAXX AC2 Private Companies

<div class="zoomable">
    <img class="img-zoomable" src="/roadmap_november_24/traxx_private_companies.webp" alt="TRAXX Overview">
</div>

Last but not least the probably biggest repaint pack with currently over 70 unique repaints for the BR 185 family made by `@Mabitze` and he isn't finished yet
Following companies are currently represented in the repaint pack:

- Lokomotion
- ITL
- Akiem
- Alpha Trains
- MRCE
- Railpool
- and many more...

Most of the liveriers feature number-dependant decals and locomotive names. Decals may vary depending on where the locomotive is leased.

## Endnote

We hope the roadmap was nice to read and we would really welcome feedback on how to improve it and if it's even worth it to create one instead of just posting it into the modding channel.
If you want to check on current WIP shots of our mods or want to ask us some questions, head over to the tsw-modding chat on the TSC-discord

Roadmap written by `@Markus` and checked by `@Raph` and `@Foobian`.
