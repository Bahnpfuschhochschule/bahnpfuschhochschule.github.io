## EANOS Mini EP

![EANOS Mini EP](/public/roadmap_november_24/eanos_pic_1.webp)

The Eanos mini EP, created by `@GER/JUSI Lp` with the help of `@Eric_0815`, will host a variety of new textures and weathered looks. It will also include new types of cargo, such as scrap metal blocks and logs.
The new textures will be randomized, meaning that passing by freight trains won't be all that boring anymore.
When spawning the freight car, you can pick between scrap metal loads or logs as your freight.
You will also have the ability, to place down the end of train boards at each end of the car by clicking the designated holder

## Austrian EMU

![What EMU could this be?](/public/roadmap_november_24/austrian_emu_sneakpeek.webp)

We proudly present: our first own electric multiple unit.
Almost all members of the BPH will work on this mod with additional help from `@Nagiphaaa`.

## Update to the 612 Enhancement Pack

![Cab of DB BR 612](/public/roadmap_november_24/br612_cab.webp)

The well recived mod for the DB BR 612 mainly made by `@Alexander L.` and `@Maggus` will be updated soon with even more features and QOL improvements.

- Redone joint sound simulation and samples
- Redone flange simulation
- More engine samples
- Ambient noise fixes
- Faster cab switches
- Many more new sound changes for you to find out
- Improved throttle simulation
- Implementation of the GSM-R!

## Frankfurt Fulda EEP

EEP you may ask? Yes. The Frankfurt Fulda Enhance and Expansion Pack, a project that almost all members are working on.
We won't spill too much information today, but here are a few things, we will already tell you:

- Completely new soundsets for both the Dostos and the BR 114
- Implementation of the 146 sound mod
- HLB 642 replacing the DB red version and subbing of the HLB BR 629
- Fitting repaints and interiors for the BR 423 and BR 425
- Station announcements
- More to be announced

## FTF 146 sound mod

Speaking of Frankfurt Fulda already, our very liked 146 sound mod, created by Foobian and Raph, will get updated soon...
It will add brand new recording samples for things such as the gearbox, horn (courtsey of Markus) and many more which will enhance the driving experience even more!
This mod will also merge with the FTF EEP once it's ready to release.

## Traxx AC2 Private Companies Livery Pack

Last but not least the probably biggest repaint pack with currently over 70 unique repaints for the BR 185 family made by Mabitze and he isn't finished yet
Following companys are currently represented in the repaint pack:

- Lokomotion
- ITL
- Akiem
- Alpha Trains
- MRCE
- Railpool
- and many more...

Most of the liveriers feature number-dependant decals and locomotive names. Decals may vary depending on where the locomotive is leased.

## Endnote

We hope the roadmap was nice to read and we would really welcome feedback on how to improve it and if it's even worth it to create one instead of just posting it into the modding channel.
If you want to check on current WIP shots of our mods or want to ask us some questions, head over to the tsw-modding chat on the TSC-discord

Roadmap written by `@Markus` and checked by `@Raph` and `@Foobian`.
